1. The shell script run-all.sh will execute the test

2. The code has been tested and verified on Ubuntu based machine as well as Amazon AWS with 8GB of memory.

3. The demo script dumps messages on the console, however we have added sufficient headings to ensure
   TA`s can easily comprehend what we are trying to do during each step and the corresponding outcome.

4. We sourced the text for the input files from Project Gutenberg, the open source digital library

Thanks
